==Product names==
I wrote a few scripts to get product names from files, but ultimately still had to hand curate the info
for repeated domains (Armadillo, etc) which were non-informative on their own.

The scripts provided work some of the way there, and I have provided the final dump of product names 
that went into the .tbl file as product_names.v2.txt
